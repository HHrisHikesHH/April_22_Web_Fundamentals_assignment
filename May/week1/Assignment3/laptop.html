          Every thing is good about the laptop but there are some issues which
          you should consider before buying the laptop.. First of all it doesn't
          have a Dual Channel memory which is a major problem about the
          laptop..like there is no reason of getting a gaming laptop with a
          single channel Ram..But if you want to upgrade the ram to 32Gb then it
          will be better for you Because in that case you will just need a
          single 16Gb stick.
